Built for developers, Rubra is an open-source project that delivers the same simplicity and intelligence as working with ChatGPT, but with a unique focus on building AI assistants powered by a locally running open-source LLM.

GPTScript is a new scripting language to automate your interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI. The ultimate goal is to create a fully natural language based programming experience. The syntax of GPTScript is largely natural language, making it very easy to learn and use. Natural language prompts can be mixed with traditional scripts such as bash and python or even external HTTP service calls.
