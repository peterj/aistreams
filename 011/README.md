# Episode 11: Deploy and run Embedchain apps on Kubernetes - Part 1

[YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/X-irXixeo1Y)

I explored Embedchain (https://embedchain.ai) in one of the previous live streams (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw_7_r63q_U).

In this unscripted stream, I will focus more on the Kubernetes side and the Kubernetes controllers.

I'll try to develop a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for an Embedchain App and a Kubernetes controller, allowing me to deploy, configure, and run Embedchain apps by deploying a piece of YAML.

In this video, I created the base Embedchain App Docker image, and we got it deployed and running on the Kubernetes cluster. In the next stream, I'll be building the Kubernetes controller.
